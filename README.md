# Worker-Fastest-API

This project aims to explore concurrency and channels.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to compare response times from different APIs, identifying the fastest API while disregarding the lowest response time.

## How It Works

1. **Concurrent Requests:** Send concurrent requests to the cep APIs.
2. **Response Time Recording:** Record the response times of each API.
3. **Identify the Fastest API:** Analyze which chann received the response firt and identify the fastest API after excluding the lowest response time.
4. **Results Display:** Display the results for analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the project using `go run main.go`.
3. View the displayed results for insights.

*Note: This project serves an educational purpose, aiming to provide understanding of concurrency and channels in Python.*
